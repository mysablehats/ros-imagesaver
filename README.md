# ros-imagesaver

A part of ros-docker packages.

TO DO:

- add option to recurse image files not based on timestamp, but on filename
- do load balancer to use 2 different nodes doing the same task with higher framerate
- increase framerate of everything so that it is as fast as it can get
- set it up to use dockerlauncher
